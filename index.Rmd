# **Aisha's Website**

Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Aisha Njie (as you probably already guessed), I am a freshman in the college, and this site is for my Statistics for the Social Sciences class. My intended major is psychology, but I also have interest in Cinema Studies and Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies. Hopefully, by the end of this semester, I'm much better at coding (fingers crossed). 

## How to use

1. fork the repo for this website and follow instructions on read me to get set up. [https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite](https://github.com/CrumpLab/LabJournalWebsite)

2. Blog/journal what you are doing in R, by editing the Journal.Rmd. See the [Journal page](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/Journal.html) for an example of what to do to get started learning R.

3. See the [links page](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/Links.html) for lots of helpful links on learning R.

4. Change everything to make it your own.
